# UCSD GPA Visualization
https://kalkulator413.github.io/vcapes/

Each bubble represents a course.</br>
The color is a measure of its average GPA (of all recorded instances on CAPE)</br>
The size is a measure of the number of students that took 
the course in the 2021-2022 academic year (including summer session)</br>
</br>
Some interesting facts:</br>
The lowest GPA average out of any course with more than 0 yearly students is 2.47, belonging to ECE 35.</br>
*Note that this does not equate to the "hardest" course.<br>
Some courses, such as Math 188, do not show up at all because the average GPA for every
iteration of the course is reported as "N/A."<br>
Inspired by <a href="https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/gpa_of_every_course_at_illinois/" target="_blank"> this visualization</a>.

Currentl Goals:
- Lump together departments under their school/college
- Add an icon
- Separate chart for time commitment of each course
